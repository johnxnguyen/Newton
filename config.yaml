# transformations and velocities
# should be defined on systems, including
# bodies.

# we should make sure that two bodies can't have the same
# position

# maybe it makes sense then to
# have a mass key for all bodies,
# and either provide a concrete
# value or a gen name.

# or do we also gen position and
# velocity of bodies

# the question is, what does radial gen generate?
# A position and a velocity? Or a transformation
# and a velocity? Remember, radial gen needs to
# work for both systems and bodies. The system nodes
# need to chain, so we can't give them concrete
# positions.

# But I'm a bit confused what kind of transformations
# these would be. Translate, scale & rotate?

# So radial gen needs to chain a rotate with a
# translate. This will still be just a single
# matrix.

# this means then, that radial gens are only in
# systems. Bodies can only use mass gens.
